  When you see this text, you have sucessfully installed A-shop. However, your job is not done yet:
  there is still some work to do:
</p>
<p class="item_title">
  <img src="images/before_item.gif" width="25" height="25" align="absmiddle" />
  administrationpanel
</p>
<p>
  To login into your administratorpanel go to the folder <a href="admin/index.asp">/admin/</a>. Here you will have to log in.<br />
  The default login is:
<ul>
    <li>LoginID: administrator</li>
    <li>Password: admin</li>
</ul>
  After logging in, you will see the main items from the adminpanel. It is important to configure "my store" first.
  Here are some items that you <b>absolutely</b> have to configure:<br /><br />

  <b><u>Update method language-file</u></b><br />
  When the file "/language.asp" does not have sufficient (write-)permissions, you have to set this to "no". If the file
  "/language.asp" has write-permissions, the script will automatically adjust this file when adding/deleting a language.
  If you do not have write-permissions on this file, you will have to do this manually (see FAQ).<br /><br />

  <b><u>Link to shop</u></b><br />
  This is the link to your shop (duh!). If your shop is located at "http://www.myshop.com/ashop/" then this is your shoplink.<br /><br />

  <b><u>Virtual path</u></b><br />
  Most important configuration of your shop!! When your shop is located at "http://www.myshop.com/ashop/" then "/ashop/" is your virtual path.
